<p>Message from Developer(Mahmud Ahmadi Nejad)- Ninad is my dream, I love Bangladesh. So I want to do something for Bangladesh. As you guys know Pipilika was our country's first search engine. But it's closed now. I want to develope a active search engine. I dont want to do any competition but at least a Bangladeshi search engine. Hope you will help me to fullfill my dream. If it's your dream too, then contact me on facebook, we will work together.</p>
